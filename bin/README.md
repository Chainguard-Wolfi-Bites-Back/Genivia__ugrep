Binaries for Windows 32-bit and 64-bit ugrep.exe are included in the
repository: building ugrep on Windows takes some serious effort to install and
compile the PCRE2 and the compression libraries together with ugrep, using the
proper configuration settings with e.g. MSVC++.

The Windows ugrep.exe build instructions are located in vs/ugrep/README.txt
