Binaries for Windows 32-bit and 64-bit ugrep.exe are included in the
repository: building ugrep on Windows takes some serious effort to install and
compile the PCRE2 and all of the compression libraries together with ugrep,
using the proper configuration settings for C++ dev tools such as MSVC++.

The Windows ugrep.exe build instructions are located in vs/ugrep/README.txt
